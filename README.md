## Overview

This version is an MVP for my Body Composition Tracker. It allows a user to log in and store their body composition measurements in a table to see trends over time.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Django
- Django Crispy Forms
- Bootstrap
- [Whitenoise](https://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/)
- Deployed with Heroku
- Email integration with SendGrid

## What I Learned

This was my first time developing a Django app with user authentication and digging into some of the customizations that are possible. I learned how to customize some of the standard workflows (such as password reset).

Getting the custom user model functioning took a lot of debugging, so I got to spend a lot of time in the Django docs, which helped me get a much stronger grasp of how Django is structured under the hood.

This was also my first time using Bootstrap, which is such an awesome resource! I love not having to spend hours trying to position elements on the page.

## Next Steps

- ~~Get password reset email functioning (currently it only outputs to the command line which isn't very useful)~~ Complete! Email integration using SendGrid is functional.
- Add a more robust 'User Settings' page
- ~~Turn the navbar menu buttons into a dropdown~~ Done!
- Add graphs to help visualize the user's progress
- Create an Articles app that will educate users about body composition best practices
